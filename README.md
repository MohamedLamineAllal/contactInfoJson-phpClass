# contactInfoJson-phpClass

That's a class that allow to easily print a concise html list from a json contact format. 
The fromat is precised, and flexible in a way. Also we are going to support more printing html format. 
But the one i took as now, is quite the best print html format (using ul list).
Format it in css the way you like. cheers!
